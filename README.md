# BookTrail

This is a Swift-based app that enables users to search for books and retrieve detailed information about them. It also displays additional books by the same author or within the same genre, using data fetched from an external book API.

## Why did I decide to build it?
 I am developing this as an intermediate project to enhance my skills in Swift and iOS app development. Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience with key concepts such as MVVM architecture, view navigation, and API integration. As an avid reader, this app appeals to me personally, as itâ€™s something I would find useful. The ability to easily discover books by the same author or within the same genre, all in one app, adds a lot of convenience and enhances the overall reading experience.

## Challenges I faced whilst building it
One challenge I faced during development was working with the API, as I had never done network calls in Swift before. It was quite different from what I was accustomed to in frontend development, and I initially found it a bit complex. However, I enjoyed the learning process and was able to overcome this challenge with the help of YouTube tutorials and guidance from my iOS mentor.
